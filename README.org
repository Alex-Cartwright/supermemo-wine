* Wine installers for SuperMemo using winetricks

...offering simple installation of SuperMemo on Linux systems using [[https://www.winehq.org/][Wine]] and [[https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks][winetricks]].

** ðŸ‘‰ Be forewarned
The Wine SuperMemo experience is not as good as the Windows SuperMemo experience. Most core features are supported, save for incremental video, certain audio/video formats, and interaction with a running instance of Internet Explorer (e.g. the mass-import from browser feature is unusable). To copy and paste HTML content into SuperMemo, prefer web pages rendered by Firefox, then run the any HTML filters within SuperMemo (@@html:<kbd>@@F6@@html:</kbd>@@) as needed.

/A more extensive compilation of caveats is planned./

Even with these apparent setbacks, I deem the behavior of SuperMemo on Wine (on Linux specifically) appropriate for daily use.

/Do not blame SuperMemo creators for incompatibilities on unsupported systems. Regressions in Wine do happen, from time to time, and may affect your experience./

** Installing
First, make sure to get *[[https://wiki.winehq.org/Download][Wine]]* and *[[https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks][winetricks]]* for your system. Then, run one of the installers provided as verbs:

: $ env WINEARCH=win32 sh winetricks arch=32 prefix=[choose a prefix name] [file].verb

By default, wine prefixes created by winetricks will be stored in the folder =~/.local/share/wineprefixes/=. 

*Quirk:* =env WINEARCH=win32= is needed at the front to avoid creation of a 64-bit prefix when an existing, default Wine prefix is already 64-bit. Installation of the required Internet Explorer 8 dependency only succeeds on a 32-bit prefix.

*** Example
To install SuperMemo 15 run:

  : $ env WINEARCH=win32 sh winetricks arch=32 prefix=supermemo15 supermemo15.verb

 The root of the wine prefix will then be =~/.local/share/wineprefixes/supermemo15/=.

*** Installation wizards
The installer takes care of running the installation of Internet Explorer 8 for SuperMemos that need it. This installation wizard needs to be attended. Any prompts to /install updates/, or /restart the system/ can be safely ignored or followed (they have no consequence). Actually restarting the system is not needed.

Installation steps in SuperMemos using installation wizards are handled automatically. Avoid moving focus away from the install wizard window during installation.

*** Running SuperMemo
On successful installation, an executable =.desktop= shortcut to start the application will be created in the Desktop folder, if already configured by your distro.

** During post-install
There are many convenient configuration steps to improve the behavior of SuperMemo. They are out of scope for these installersâ€“they're just concerned with the installation. However, consider the following:

*** Do not use the Wine prefix for collection data
Since wine prefixes can be removed with simple commands, it is recommended that you /do not store new collection data inside the wine prefix/. Do it in a dedicated folder that survives it, such as =~/sm/collections/=.

*** How to configure the Wine prefix
The canonical command to configure the wine prefix the software has been installed into is: 

 : $ env WINEPREFIX=/path/to/wine/prefix winecfg

It is useful to disable handling of file associations with crippled Wine applications, so disable: 

/Wine configuration â†’ Desktop integration â†’ Mime types â†’ [ ] Manage file associations/.

** Uninstalling
From the WineHQ Wiki ([[https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks#How_to_remove_things_installed_by_Winetricks][source]]):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Winetricks does not provide a way to uninstall individual apps or DLLs inside a Wine prefix. This is for several reasons, but mainly because the preferred way to uninstall anything in Wine is to simply install into a fresh Wine prefix.
#+END_QUOTE

*Be sure to back up any data saved in C:\\SuperMemo\\ you might need*.

To uninstall SuperMemo, simply delete the corresponding Wine prefix via =winetricks annihilate=. For instance, to uninstall SuperMemo 15 from the winetricks-managed prefix named /supermemo15/, run:

: $ env WINEARCH=win32 sh winetricks prefix=supermemo15 annihilate

From the winetricks command-line help:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
annihilate

Delete ALL DATA AND APPLICATIONS INSIDE THIS WINEPREFIX
#+END_QUOTE

** Why add the winetricks dependency?
- winetricks may have produced the only reproducible 32-bit Internet Explorer 8 installation recipe that is kept up to date; it is rather complex and maintaining a separate one requires resources better spent elsewhere.
- winetricks has convenient shell functions for basic dependency management, checking download integrity, detecting existing installations, user interface automation via AutoHotKey, among others.
- advanced users will know which bits of winetricks to use or discard.

** Sources
It is safe to skip this section if all you need is run the installers.

*** Template
A template for a winetricks verb abstracts commonalities between install actions performed by SuperMemo installers. It makes use of official, published URLs. Installers not published are to be downloaded separately (for example, attached to your order from the [[https://super-memo.com/index.html][Super Memory Store]]).
